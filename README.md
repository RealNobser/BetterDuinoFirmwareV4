# BetterDuino Firmware V4

## What is the MarcDuino system?
(from https://www.curiousmarc.com/r2-d2/marcduino-system):

"The MarcDuino system controls the animatronics of an R2 (dome panels, light and sound). It currently controls 10 dome panels, an "MP3 Trigger" sound board, dome "Teeces" lights and holoprojectors light and movements, and I2C gizmos you can add-in yourself. It has lots of pre-programmed effects making all these act together.

The system is centered around the MarcDuino boards which sit in the R2. There are two kinds, the Master and the Slave board, which are very similar to each other." - CuriousMarc

## What is BetterDuino Firmware V4?
The BetterDuinoFirmwareV4 software is a **firmware replacement** for the original MarcDuino V1.5Rev3 boards. 

Details about the **boards** can be found here:

The **original firmware** can be found here:

https://www.curiousmarc.com/r2-d2/marcduino-system/marcduino-software-reference

There also is a **spinoff** of Marcs firmware also known as **MarcDuinoMain V3** and **MarcDuinoClient V3**:

## Important Disclaimer
***BetterDuinoFirmwareV4 has nothing to do with the original firmware made by Marc nor with the spinoff made by Neil! So if you have any questions about BetterDuino Firmware V4 don't ask any of them!***

***If you find any issues, please use the github "Issues" mechanism above. When you are an experienced software developer please feel free to submit pull requests. This is a living repository and I appreciate any community input!***

If there are still questions not anserwed here, feel free to visit Michael Baddeleys fantastic Printed Droid community here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/MrBaddeley . You will be treated in a fair and polite way and we will find a solution or answer to your questions!

*Update:* Now there also is a BetterDuino support thread on Astromech.net: https://astromech.net/forums/showthread.php?44309-MarcDuino-Replacement-Firmware

Nevertheless: Read and understand, how the boards work, why there is a master and a slave board, how the boards are connected ->

## Why a Replacement Firmware for MarcDuino boards?
The last update to the original firmware was in 2018. Neil's last update was a minor change in mid-2022. His V3 software has about 80% of the original source in common, adding some features for the latest MarcDuino boards (servo controllers and EXT/AUX pin controllers). He also added the nice feature of saving settings to EEPROM at runtime. But the code also has some glitches and bugs and is based on outdated Arduino libraries. I started 2023 after the whole Arduino framework and community has made really great progress in the last 5 years.

The BetterDuino Firmware V4 code has completely been rewritten from scratch. I took Neils idea of the EEPROM storage a step further, so nearly ***any*** setting is stored there. Including per-servo position settings. I also added the new panel animation of Tim Hebel who is also using a modified MarcDuino V3 firmware (https://github.com/Eebel/SHADOW_MD_EEBEL).

### New Features (excerpt)
- Support for MP3 Trigger, DF Mini Player and R2-D2 / Astromech Vocalizer (https://humancyborgrelations.com/)
- Identical firmware for Master, Slave and Body
- Automatic configuration of Master and Slave at first startup
- per servo runtime settings for min/max and open/close positions
- switch to modern OOP software design and use of most recent common Arduino libraries
- fixed a lot of bugs at least of the V3 spinoff
- ...

MarcDuino Command Set (V4 only)
===============================

Unsupported original MarcDuino features
=======================================

· no Panel/Servo RC_IN support

· some configuration commands are not supported / necessary due to cleaned command processing / storage

Commands
========

Routing
-------

All commands are sent to the master board. The slave board is always connected to the master board. Slave boards are not running in stand-alone mode. So the master board decides what to do with the commands. It might process or even omit the command.

![MD Routing](https://github.com/RealNobser/BetterDuinoFirmwareV4/blob/main/assets/MarcDuino%20Routing.png)

Format
------

Every command must start with one of these special characters (defined in the header file). The start character is recognized in the main loop:

--------------

They must follow the syntax ":CCxx\\r" where CC=command , xx= two digit decimal number, \\r is carriage return.

I2C Commands (Classic, Master-Mode)
============
**Source:**

https://www.curiousmarc.com/r2-d2/marcduino-system/marcduino-software-reference/marcduino-command-reference#h.p_EQOGPlR2RuOk

If you send a command following the format:

***&I2Caddress, data, data, data...**

an I2C write command will be generated on all the I2C ports in the MarcDuino chain (master and all slaves). The write command will be addressed to the device at I2Caddress and will write all the data bytes provided in order.

Data can be decimal numbers, hex bytes, characters or strings, depending on the prefix appended to the data, as follows.

Decimals need no prefix. Valid range is -128 to 255. For example, to send command 2 (decimal) to an I2C device at address 25:

***&25,2**

To send an hex byte, add x as a prefix. To send the hex byte 0xFF to device 25:

***&25,xFF***

To send a single character, use the ' prefix

***&25,'c***

To send a string, use the " prefix. Don't put another " at the end or it will be transmitted as part of the string...

***&25,"Hello World  (note: there is no second " at the end of the string)***

And of course you can mix everything:

***&25,2,xFF,'c,"Hello World***

I2C Commands (New, Slave-Mode)
==============================
MarcDuino boards with NewDuino firmware are enabled to receive any serial command also as I2C slave via the I2C interface. So other componetes beside the main control system (ShadowMD etc.) are able to execute commands or start sequences (e.g. dome lift). The protocol is pretty simple, just send an I2C message to one of the following slave addresses with data payload identical to one of the commands described above (don't forget dto finalise the command with 0x0a = '\r' = Carriage Return.

| **I2C-Address (dec/hex)** | **Type** |
| --- | --- |
|50/0x32|MarcDuino Dome Master|
|51/0x33|MarcDuino Dome Slave|
|52/0x34|MarcDuino Body Master|

I2C addresses can be changed in include/config.h if needed.


Best practice panel adjustment
==============================

- Connect a serial interface to the "XBEE/SERIAL IN" port of your board
- Open a serial terminal program and connect via 9600 Baud, 8N1. Activate character echo in your terminal program.
- Use the new "Move Panel" (:MVxxdddd) command to get a feeling, which is the area, the servo moves within.
- If you find a valid position for "open", store it with the command "Store Open" (#SOxxdddd)
- If you find a valid position for "closed", store it with the command "Store Closed" (#SCxxdddd)

*Example:*
- If you think, ":MV010900" moves panel/servo #1 to a valid open position, store the setting with "#SO010900"
- If you think, ":MV011750" moves panel/servo #1 to a valid closed position, store the setting with "#SC011750"
- :MVxxdddd does not store any position, it just moves the servo to the PWM/degree value

*Shortcut*
- If the default positions are fine but swapped (:OP01 closes the panel and :CL01 opens it), just use "#SW01" to swap the values for open and closed position. The values are automatically stored. Important: That command is not identical to the "Reverse Servo" command. Just use the swap command while calibrating your servos, not at every startup. Otherwise it will always toggle the settings on every startup.
- Repeat all the steps until each servo is calibrated

Connection Dome Lift to MarcDuino boards
========================================
Please use BetterDuino firmware V1.0.8 or higher. New I2C slave mode must be activated (standard in BetterDuino, classic I2C Master mode also available in dedicated firmware, see config.h).
- Connect Master InterCom-TX to Dome Lift RX0
- Connect I2C bus from MarcDuino board to Dome Lift Board
- Use modified dome lift firmware (https://github.com/RealNobser/DomeLiftMechanism/tree/main)
- New MarcDuino comand is :LIxx. To be compatible with the R2Touch-App the command mapping is as follows:
  
| **Cmd** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| :LI07 | Bad Motivator |
| :LI08 | Dome Zapper |
| :LI09 | Lightsaber |
| :LI10 | Life Form |
| :LI11 | Periscope |


EEPROM Memory Map
